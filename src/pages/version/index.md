#### Version 0.1 - October 13th, 2018
The launch of the first initial version. The design and content of this page is inspired by [Jonathan Verrecchia's personal site](https://verekia.com/). I'm not a designer and no matter how hard I try I cannot comprehend visual design.

Really.

So consider this an homage to his.

**Why Gatsby.js?** Why not? Although I've been tempted to write everything in vanilla lately (and my next side project is centered around that) I figured it would be good to use at least one static site generator for something.

**Why Netlify?** Again, why not? Actually, there's many good reasons for Netlify. It automates a lot of the minutiae of launching a static site. In a past life I would have used Heroku or perhaps even made more of an effort and used AWS Lambdas with an S3 bucket. But this [starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) proved to be so fast that I couldn't pass it up.
