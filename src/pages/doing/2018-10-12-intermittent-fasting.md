There have been lots of studies on Intermittent Fasting, IF for short, and the early results are looking [good](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156).

I've committed to IF for the short (or maybe long) term future. The list of potential benefits include feeling more focused, energetic, burning fat easier, and all sorts of other positive effects. Whether it's actually happening...I couldn't say, but it does _feel_ like it's working.
