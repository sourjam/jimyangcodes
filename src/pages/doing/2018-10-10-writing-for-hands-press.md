Despite having mostly given up fiction writing [years ago](https://medium.com/human-parts/almost-a-lawyer-90a46374fecf) I pitched a 3-part short form series for [HANDS Press](https://www.handspress.com/). It's based on a 10-minute play I wrote years ago and it's been a fun diversion from my usual endless thinking about programming and software.

There's only one piece left to submit so I'm not sure what I'll be doing afterwards. More writing? Giving it up completely? In some ways this feels like a swan song but I certainly can't deny how much I still enjoy writing prose.
