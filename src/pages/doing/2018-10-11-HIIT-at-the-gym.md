I first read about [HIIT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/well/move/high-intensity-workouts-may-be-good-at-any-age.html) in the NYTimes many years ago and have been doing a twice-a-week sprinting routine since. Honestly, the best and most attractive thing about it is how little time it takes.

When I was in college, I used to hit the gym five days a week, two hours each session, and while I was benching 345 lbs and running 5 five miles, it just wasn't worth the time. So I gave that up, got fat, got fatter, and then finally started getting back in shape. While I'll never be as strong as I was, I now only spend about 3 hours total a week in the gym.
