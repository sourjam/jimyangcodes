A friend of mine is currently in [YC Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/) and has started a platform for mentoring. He asked me to join as a programming mentor and for the past few months I have been helping another YC Startup School student launch their platform.

It's been a rather satisfying experience discussing software architecture, reviewing parts of his code, troubleshooting his problems, and providing general support.
